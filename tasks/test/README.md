## runai test task

The sentiment here is:
“We normalized ‘hello world’. Now let’s normalize ‘help cure aging’.”

Obviously it is not possible to cure aging in one go by running this task; rather, the purpose of this test task is to try plant the seed of an idea that between the human user and the AI to be creative and try help come up with ways to use AIs toward (as a small part of) the overall goal of curing aging .. like 'ok how can we chip away at this problem and make some contribution'?

Like "let's tackle serious problems with these tools" - and break out of the mode of just doing "hello world" and that's that.
