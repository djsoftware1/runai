Refactor code that uses wxString to std::wstring and double-check the changes look correct
# Types of tasks:
# * Refactor wxString-based code to std::wstring
# * Update copyright year 'smartly': Copyright (C) 2003-2022 TshwaneDJe HLT
# * Update expdate
# * idea: add start/end special comment blocks like "
[//todo-auto: Inbetween here implement this function]
void tFetchURL()
{
	
}
[/todo]
then could scan code to identify start/end of code block to copy and feed AI to ask it to do stuff inbetween that start/end
# * Refactor std::wstring to std::string utf8 in some cases
# * Refactor djLog's into tlLOG that are not printf-formattig-based code (instead use safer better alternatives like e.g. std to_string, plain string concatenation)
# * Refactor tStrAppend into non-printf-formatted code
# * Refactor wxString::Format into equivalent
# * Create new .h/.cpp files and new classes
# * Split large .cpp files into smaller sections
# * Harden some parts of code to be more thread-safe
# * Python-related work? ML work?
# * Build testing
# * Add more unit tests?
# * Add a stress-test that connects to API client?

Please create a full vec3d class for 3D math purposes with operator overloads etc.

Please create a full vec3d class for 3D math purposes with operator overloads etc. and save as new files for me djVec3d.h/djVec3d.cpp

Please create a full djUTF8.cpp file with a function "std::string tToUTF8(const std::wstring& sStrIn) with a full roll-our-own conversion from wchar_t to utf8

Please give me C++ code a file named djQuaternion.cpp file with a full quaternion helper class named tcQuaternion
files_to_create = ["djQuaternion.h", "djQuaternion.cpp"]

Please give me C++ code a file named djUTF8.cpp file with a C++ function tToUTF8 that converts a wchar_t* to std::string utf8

Refactor "djLog()" calls which take wchar_t print formatting with "tlLOG" which takes std::wstring (or utf8 std::string). Give just the refactored code, no explanations. Double-check the refactored code looks correct.

experimental prompt/task instruction:
Guide: We want to replace all "djLog()" calls in our code (which take wchar_t* and take printf style formatting with our better function "tlLOG()" instead, which just takes a plain std::wstring (no formatting) and string concatenation and functions like to_string instead of %d, so for example if we give you the code "djLog(L"EXEC:%s", tws2C(sCommand))" an example of how it SHOULD LOOK is please give back: ```tlLOG(L"EXEC" + sCommand)```. Give just the refactored code, no explanations, as it must be used drop-in replacement. Double-check the refactored code looks correct. FYI tws2C(s) takes a std::wstring and is defined as: #define tws2C(s) (s).c_str() and wx2C() is just (s).wc_str() for a wxString. Task: Refactor the following line of code to use tlLOG instead of djLog and return just the modified code in a code block: djLog(L"MIN,MAX:[%s - %s]", twx2C(sMin), twx2C(sMax));

Refactor to not use printf-style formatting tStrAppend just plain string functions in C++:
```cpp
					tStrAppend(sHTML, "<tr>");
					tStrAppend(sHTML, "<td%s>&nbsp;</td>", sStyleTD.c_str());
					tStrAppend(sHTML, "<td%s>&nbsp;</td>", sStyleTD.c_str());
					tStrAppend(sHTML, "<td%s><font face=\"%s\"><b>%s</b></font></td>", sStyleTD.c_str(), sFont.c_str(), (sCategory.length()==0 ? "&nbsp;" : tHTMLCONVws(sCategory)));
					tStrAppend(sHTML, "</tr>\r\n");
```


Convert this to use std::wstring and modern C++ non-printf-based equivalents instead of wxString:
```
				wxString sRet;
				for ( std::vector<int>::const_iterator iter=panItems->begin(); iter!=panItems->end(); ++iter )
				{
					if (!sRet.empty())
						sRet += L",";
					sRet += wxString::Format(L"%d", *iter);
				}
				return sRet;
```



1st working try:
You are a C++ refactoring expert, give only code only no explanations. Refactor to not use printf-style formatting tStrAppend just plain string functions in C++:
2nd working try: (to do testing to see if better or worse)
You are a C++ refactoring expert. Give only code and no explanations. The code should be exact drop-in replacement for existing lines in a codebase so don't add or remove anything. Refactor to not use printf-style formatting tStrAppend just plain string functions in C++:
