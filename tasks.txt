Refactor code that uses wxString to std::wstring and double-check the changes look correct
# Types of tasks:
# * Refactor wxString-based code to std::wstring
# * Refactor std::wstring to std::string utf8 in some cases
# * Refactor djLog's into tlLOG that are not printf-formattig-based code (instead use safer better alternatives like e.g. std to_string, plain string concatenation)
# * Refactor wxString::Format into equivalent
# * Split large .cpp files into smaller sections
# * Harden some parts of code to be more thread-safe
# * Python-related work? ML work?
# * Build testing
# * Add more unit tests
